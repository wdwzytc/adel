General introduction 
**********************

ADEL-Wheat (Architectural model of DEvelopment based on L-systems) is designed for
simulating the 3D architectural development of the shoots of wheat plants. The model has been
coupled with a light model adapted to field conditions (Caribu model), in order to allow calculating the
light interception by individual phytoelements during the crop cycle. Applications of such a tool range from the
interpretation of remote-sensing signals, to the estimation of crop light use efficiency, or to the
assistance in the ecophysiological analysis of plant response to light conditions.
The model is based on an analysis of developmental and geometrical similarities that exist among phytomers, to allow a
concise parameterisation. Parameterising the model requires using experimental data to document a set of inputs described below.

Beside these user inputs, Adel also make use of constants and of relations (set and 'readable' in Adel.R, but not documented)
describing coordination of leaves, dynamics of geometry, computation of visibility and progression of senescence as a function of ssi.
See Robert et al (Functional Plant Biology 2008) for description. The next figure 
shows the global dataflow of Adel:

Simulations are visually realistic. And the model was shown to correctly reproduce important agronomic features such as kinetics of LAI and of plant height.

.. _adel_input:

Description of Adel's inputs
*******************************

Adel requires three kinds of inputs to be provided by the user:

 * inputs characterizing the development of plants in the canopy (topology, developmental rate and size of plants)
 * inputs characterizing the geometry of axes and of leaves
 * inputs characterizing the simulation (time step..) and the plot configuration (number of plants, position)


Units and conventions
- Dimension are expressed in cm
- Thermal time is expressed in Â°CD

Position of a phytomer on an axis: Most often (as described below) phytomer position in Adel are counted acropetally and are normalized relatively to the total number of phytomers
(leaf 1 relative position is 1/nf and flag leaf relative position is 1). Use of relative positions was chosen to allow sharing data between axes differing by the total number of phytomers
In later versions of Adel the relative phytomer number should be changed by the absolute one. With the convention that 1 is referring to the first true leaf.


.. _development_input:

Inputs describing development
=================================
Development is parameterized in a Rlist containing 3 tables (:ref:`axeT <axeT>`, :ref:`dimT <dimT>` and :ref:`phenT <phenT>`). 

These tables have dependencies (cross references). However some may be compatible with others if cross references are maintained. This allows for recombination of parameters.

.. _axeT:

axeT : *Master table allowing to organize the information plant per plant*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
:ref:`axeT <axeT>` is the master table that organizes how each plant is described.
For each plant, the table contains a few explicit parameters that describe the phenology and the number of modules (eg time of appearance, number of axes and number of leaves on axes)
and identifiers that refer to information given in the other tables (:ref:`dimT <dimT>`, :ref:`phenT <phenT>`, :ref:`earT <earT>`).

All plants to be used for the reconstruction must be listed in :ref:`axeT <axeT>`. If only one plant is given, Adel will clone that plant. 
To have a correct simulation of tiller dynamics at the plot level, a minimum of 30 plants is recommended.

There is one line per axis. Columns are :

.. _dimT:

dimT : *description of the dimensions of leaf blades, sheath and internodes*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:ref:`dimT <dimT>` allows to describe a number of profiles of dimension, each profile 
being associated to a value of id_dim. Dimensions of organs must be given for each 
of the id_dim mentioned in :ref:`axeT <axeT>`.

Positions on an axis are expressed as relative position (index_rel_phytomer = phytomer rank/N_phytomer);

Use of relative position makes it possible to use a same profile of dimension for axes differing in the final number of phytomers (N_phytomer);
Use of relative position makes it possible to document a profile with only some the phytomers on an axis:
Missing data will be estimated by linear interpolation according to index_rel_phytomer;  

Actual dimension of the blade, sheath and internode of an axis are hence calculated according to id_dim and N_phytomer.

There is one line per phytomer documented.

Columns are :

.. list-table::
    :widths: 10 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Column
      - Description
    * - **id_dim**
      - the identifier referred to in :ref:`axeT <axeT>`. By convention, if the current id_dim 
        ends by ``0`` (e.g. id_dim=1110), then the current line documents 
        the dimensions of a regressive axis. If the current id_dim ends by 
        ``1`` (e.g. id_dim=1111), then the current line documents the 
        dimensions of a non-regressive axis.
    * - **index_rel_phytomer** 
      - The relative phytomer position : index_rel_phytomer = phytomer rank/N_phytomer
    * - **L_blade**
      - length of the mature blade (cm)
    * - **W_blade**
      - Maximum width of the mature leaf blade (cm)
    * - **L_sheath** 
      - Length of a mature sheath (cm)
    * - **W_sheath** 
      - Diameter of the stem or pseudo stem at the level of sheath (cm)
    * - **L_internode** 
      - Length of an internode (cm)
    * - **W_internode** 
      - Diameter of an internode (cm)
      
See :download:`an example of dimT <../../test/data/test_plantgen/MIN_MIN/dimT.csv>`.


.. _phenT:

phenT : *description of phenology of axes*
-----------------------------------------------------------------
:ref:`phenT <phenT>` controls the dynamics of leaf appearance, ligulation, senescence and disappearance.
Internal rules of Adel coordinate sheaths and internodes to the blades so that :ref:`phenT <phenT>` 
controls indirectly the whole dynamics of plant development.

Positions on an axis are expressed as relative positions.

One timing of development has to be documented for each value taken by id_phen in :ref:`axeT <axeT>`; axes sharing a same value of id_phen will share the same timing;
Use of relative position makes it possible to use a same developmental timing for axes differing in the final number of phytomers;
Use of relative position makes it possible to document a developmental timing with a number of value higher than the number of phytomers on an axis:
this is required because the dynamics of SSI shows a complex behavior(see below)

Timing of developmental events on a leaf is given relative to the timing of the event on leaf 1 of the axis;
Actual timing is computed from :ref:`phenT <phenT>` and the data concerning leaf 1 in :ref:`axeT <axeT>`. 

For each id_phen, there is one line per value of index_rel_phytomer documented. For a smooth description of the 
dynamics of SSI from crop appearance to maturity, approximately 40 values of index_rel_phytomer should be documented (for each value of id_phen).
More over for each value of id_phen, one line should be documented for index_rel_phytomer = 0, so as to allow interpolation.

Columns are :

.. list-table::
    :widths: 10 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Column
      - Description
    * - **id_phen** 
      - the index referred to in :ref:`axeT <axeT>`
    * - **index_rel_phytomer** 
      - normalized phytomer position, starting from index_rel_phytomer = 0
    * - **dTT_em_phytomer** 
      - Thermal time of the appearance of the tip of leaf out of the whorl made by the older blade; expressed as thermal time since TT_em_phytomer1
    * - **dTT_col_phytomer**
      - Thermal time of the appearance of collar; expressed as thermal time since TT_col_phytomer1
    * - **dTT_sen_phytomer** 
      - Thermal time for which SSI = n (where n is the phytomer rank); expressed as thermal time since TT_sen_phytomer1
    * - **dTT_del_phytomer** 
      - Thermal time after which the leaf blade is destroyed and is not displayed in the 3D mock-up anymore; expressed as thermal time since TT_del_phytomer1

.. _ssi2sen:

ssi2sen : *description of progression of senescence in upper leaf blades as a function of SSI*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adel considers two categories of phytomers for describing the progression of senescence in leaf blades.

* for lower leaves, the senescence progresses linearly as function of SSI and blades sequentially: the senescence of blade at rank n starts when senescence of blade n-1 has finished. 
  This means that the senesced fraction of leaf n is : 1+SSI -n. It depends only in ssi and there is no need for additional parameters.
* for upper leaves, the progress of senescence is more complex and several leaf blades senesce simultaneously: 
  SSi2senT contains data to calculate the fraction of senesced area of each upper leaves as function of ssi.

The upper leaves correspond approximately to the leaves beard by an elongated internode. 
The number of lower leaves showing a linear progress of senescence is called Nsenlow;
The number of upper leaves showing a complex progress is called Nsenup

All upper leaf blades start to senesce at the same time, that is at :math:`SSI = Nsenlow`; 
Senescence of each upper leaf blade progresses first at a slow rate,identical for all leaves, then at a fast rate.

The parameter used to describe these kinetics are the value of the slow rate (R_sen1), the value of ssi (dssit1) at the onset of fast senescence 
and the value of SSI (dssit2) at full senescence for each upper leaf. 

The table defines the parameter values for the upper leaves.
There is one line per upper leaf and the number of lines of the file must be Nsenup
The values d_SSIt1 and dssit2 are specified in term of difference with the ssi at onset of upper leaves senecence (Nsenlow)

It should be noted that the present description of progress of senescence is over-parameterized, resulting in a constraint between parameters value.
This comes from the fact that at any time the sum of the rate of progress of senescence for all leaves should be one. 
Complying with this constraint is not straightforward. So a user that do not know precisely the value of parameters in his experiment should probably use the default values to ensure a consistent behavior.


.. list-table::
    :widths: 10 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Column
      - Description
    * - **N_senup**
      - Number of leaves that show two phases during senescence (the value is repeated for all lines!)
    * - **R_sen1**
      - Rate of progress of senescence during phase 1 (the value is repeated for all lines !)
    * - **dssit1**
      - (SSI when the leaf blade starts phase 2) - Nsenlow)
    * - **dssit2**  
      - (SSI when the leaf blade is 100% senesced - Nsenlow)



Inputs describing geometry
=============================
Input are required to define the geometry of leaves (normalized 2D shape, midrib curvature and azimuth) and the geometry of stems (inclination, azimuth)

Normalized 2D shapes are leaf width variations with distance to the base of the leaf, both axes being normalized so that max values is 1.

Normalized 2D shapes and midrib curvature are stored as collections and Adel will draw and individual leaf by scaling a 2D shape plus taking a midrib curvature from these collections. 

The inclination of axes is defined by two parameters DredT and Tillerinc.
DredT represents the horizontal distance between the main stem and a tiller at flowering.
Tillerinc represents the angle of insertion of a tiller at flowering.
When a tiller grows, it starts with angle of 3Â° compared to the vertical. Then, during the period of extension of the lower internode, insertion angle increases up to the value Tillerinc.
It will keep this value until the top of the stem reaches the distance DredT from the main stem. When this is reach, 
the two upper visible nodes rotate so that the top of the tillers remains at distance DredT. Any internode that elongate
later is vertical. Note that when sheath disappear, new node become visible and will become involved in the process.

genGoeaxe (see below) includes a parameter to randomly tilt the main stem of a small value around the vertical. When the main stem is tilted, all the plant follows


How to specify the geometric data
---------------------------------
The collections for 2D leaf shape and for leaf curvature should be specified as one list of lists of matrices for 2D shape and one list of matrices for midrib curvature.

* the first level in the list is for collection index 
* the second level is for matrix index.

See alea for more information.

Besides these collections, R functions should be provided as inputs. A first list of function is for defining the axis geometry;
A second list of functions is for selecting shapes in the collections mentioned above.

The first list should provide 3 R functions of axis number (0 = main stem) that return:
    * **azT** : the azimuth(deg) of the first leaf of the axis with reference to the azimuth of the parent axes
    * **incT** : the inclination (deg) of the base of the tiller compared with main stem
    * **dredT** : the distance (at maturity) between tiller and main stem

These functions can be generated by the predefined *genGeoAxe* node or be freely user-defined in a *freeGeoAxe* node.

In genGeoAxe 
The azimuth of a tiller stem is the same as that of the axilling main stem leaf. 
The azimuth of the first leaf of a primary tiller is with an angle of 75Â° relatively to that of the axilling main stem leaf.
For secondary tillers, the azimuth of the first leaf is also with a fixed angle relatively to that of the parent tiller.


A sample code of "geoAxe" function is:                                              

.. code-block:: r

    geoAxe <- list(
      azT = function(a) {
        ifelse(a == 0, 0, 75 + (runif(1)-0.5)*5) 
      },
      incT = function(a) {
        ifelse(a == 0, runif(1) * 5, 82 + (runif(1) - .5) * 5)
      },
      dredT = function(a) {
        ifelse(a == 0, 0, runif(1) * 7)
      }
    )


The second list should provide two Rfunctions for drawing in the collections of leaf shape

Inputs have to be axis number, leaf position, leaf position counted from top, and leaf stage, defined as current length/final length. 
Returned values have to be :

    * **azim** : the azimuth (deg) of the leaf compared to the previous one
    * **Lindex** : the index of the collection to use for leaf curvature

These functions can be generated by the predefined genGeoLeaf node or be freely user-defined in a *freeGeoLeaf* node:

A sample code for a "geoLeaf" function is be : 

.. code-block:: r

    geoLeaf <- list(
        Azim = function(a,n,ntop) {0 * runif(1)},
        Lindex = function(a,n,ntop,stage) {ntop + 1}
        

Inputs describing simulation
===============================
Time step is given as a list of values of thermal times for which a mock-up is to be produced.
Positions of plants within the plot are given externally from adel to a planter.


Inner options of ADEL 
========================

.. todo:: add reference to C.Fournier's and B.Andrieu's publications which describe 
          the working hypotheses, and remove the following subsections.

This section documents the inner options of ADEL.

Coordination in organ extension
----------------------------------
The thermal time of leaf tip appearance and leaf collar appearance given in :ref:`phenT <phenT>` are used to calculate a number of features;
- the leaf extension (blade + sheath) is simulated as starting 0,4 phyllochron between tip appearance, and having a constant rate (cm.Â°C-1.J-1) for a duration of 2 phyllochrons
- The model calculate the length of the hidden part of a leaf (whorl length) : at tip emergence, this hidden length is the blade length; 
at collar emergence this hidden length is taken as the length of sheath n-1; Between it is approximated by linear interpolation. 
This is used to calculate the length of the visible part of the leaf in the post processing treatments. Note that this calculation is not fully accurate because sheath n-1 stop growing before collar n emerges

The leaf extension is simulated as consisting sequentially of the blade extension, followed by the sheath extension. 

The internode extension is simulated as following sequentially the sheath extension, and taking place at a constant rate, for a duration of 1/(stemleaf) phyllochron
It is known that in grass, internode fast extension start at collar emergence. However there is no such calculation of collar emergence in the model: 
it expected that the synchronization with collar emergence will be reasonably well approximated by the synchronization implemented with the end of leaf extension.

The parameters for these coordinations are defined in AdelRunOption, which remained to be documented


Senescence of sheath and internodes
------------------------------------
The senescence of sheath n is simulated as being synchronous with the senescence of blade n+2
The disappearance of sheath n is simulated as synchronous with disappearance of blade n+1

There is no senescence implemented for internodes : they stay green.
For ear and peduncle : to be documented

On regressing tillers, individual leaf senescence is simulated from SSI with the same pattern as on non-regressing tillers.


Disappearance of dead tillers
-------------------------------
A dead tiller can be programmed to disappear some time after it stops growing. 
Only the blades and sheaths, not the internodes, disappear. This will be changed in further version, so that internode also disappear
When this happens, it has priority over the process of disappearance following leaf senescence. 


.. _plantgen:

Construction of the input tables 
***********************************

ADEL requires inputs characterizing the development of plants as described 
in :ref:`development_input`.

The :mod:`plantgen <alinea.adel.plantgen>` package allows the user who does not have 
a complete set of data to estimate the missing inputs. 
Inside this package, the module :mod:`plantgen_interface <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen_interface>` is 
the front-end for the generation of the tables :ref:`axeT <axeT>`, :ref:`dimT <dimT>` 
and :ref:`phenT <phenT>`. :mod:`plantgen_interface <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen_interface>` 
also permits to generate some other tables for debugging purpose. 
To construct :ref:`axeT <axeT>`, :ref:`dimT <dimT>`, :ref:`phenT <phenT>` and the debugging 
tables, the module :mod:`plantgen_interface <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen_interface>` 
uses the modules :mod:`plantgen_core <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen_core>`, 
:mod:`tools <alinea.adel.plantgen.tools>` and module :mod:`params <alinea.adel.plantgen.params>`. 
The diagram :ref:`static view <plantgen_static>` describes the dependencies 
between the different modules of the package :mod:`plantgen <alinea.adel.plantgen>`. 

.. todo:: add reference to M.Abichou's publication which describes the working hypotheses.

We have considered three possible levels of completeness of data, denoted as MIN, 
SHORT, and FULL. In the next subsections, we: 

* describe the levels of completeness of the data and of the parameters set 
  by the user,
* describe how to construct the inputs of ADEL from a Python interpreter, 
  using the routine :func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>`. 
  This routine can be used whatever the level of completeness of the raw inputs, 
  adapting the processing automatically,
* describe how to construct the inputs of ADEL from the Visualea interface, 
  using the node ``plantgen``.
        
:func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>` 
belongs to module :mod:`plantgen_interface <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen_interface>`. 
:func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>` 
produces the following tables: 

* :ref:`axeT <axeT>`
* :ref:`dimT <dimT>`
* :ref:`phenT <phenT>`
* :ref:`phenT_abs <phenT_abs>`: the equivalent of :ref:`phenT <phenT>`, but 
  with absolute thermal times and absolute positions.
* :ref:`dimT_abs <dimT_abs>`: the equivalent of :ref:`dimT <dimT>`, but with 
  absolute positions.
* :ref:`dynT <dynT>`: the dynamic of the leaves for each type of axis. 
* :ref:`phenT_first <phenT_first>`: a subset of :ref:`phenT_abs <phenT_abs>`, 
  containing only the lines of :ref:`phenT_abs` which correspond to the first 
  phytomer of each axis.
* :ref:`HS_GL_SSI_T <HS_GL_SSI_T>`: the dynamic of Haun stage, green leaves and 
  senescent leaves when thermal time varies, for each cohort.
* :ref:`tilleringT <tilleringT>`: the dynamic of tillering.
* :ref:`cardinalityT <cardinalityT>`: the theoretical and the simulated 
  cardinalities of each cohort and each axis.
  
:func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>` 
also produces a dictionary which stores the values of the arguments of 
:func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>`. 
This dictionary is aimed to log the configuration used for the construction. 

The diagram :ref:`dynamic view <plantgen_dynamic>` describes 
the data flow when the user calls :func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>`.

.. _levels_of_completeness:

The levels of completeness
=============================
The information needed to generate Adel input must be provided in two tables: 
``dynT_user`` and ``dimT_user``. ``dynT_user`` and ``dimT_user`` can  have 
different  levels  of  completeness:  ``FULL``,  ``SHORT`` and  ``MIN``.  
According  to  their  level  of completeness, ``dynT_user`` and ``dimT_user`` 
take different shapes and/or contents.

The table below list the specific designation in :func:`plantgen <alinea.adel.plantgen>`

.. _construct_inputs_from_interpreter:

Construction of Adel input tables using the Python interpreter
================================================================
:func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>` 
can be used from Python interpreter.

First we explain the arguments of :func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>` 
that the user has to define. Second we present a complete code example to use 
:func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>` 
from a Python interpreter.


.. _user_arguments:          

The arguments to define by the user
-------------------------------------
The arguments to define are:

* *dynT_user*: the leaf dynamic parameters set by the user,
* *dimT_user*: the dimensions of the axes set by the user,
* *plants_number*: the number of plants to be generated,
* *plants_density*: the number of plants that are present 
  after loss due to bad emergence, early death..., per square meter,
* *decide_child_axis_probabilities*: the probability of emergence of an axis 
  when the parent axis is present. *decide_child_axis_probabilities* are set 
  only for axes belonging to primaries tillers.
* *MS_leaves_number_probabilities*: the probability distribution 
  of the final number of main stem leaves,
* *ears_density*: the number of ears per square meter,
* *GL_number*: the thermal times of GL measurements and corresponding values of green leaves number, 
* *delais_TT_stop_del_axis*: the thermal time between an axis stop growing and its disappearance,
* *TT_hs_break*: the thermal time when the rate of progress Haun Stage vs thermal time is changing. 
  If phyllochron is constant, then *TT_hs_break* is 0.0.
* *inner_params*: the values to overwrite the inner parameters with. See 
  :ref:`inner_parameters_for_construction` for more details. 
  
.. important:: 
  
    * :func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>` 
      checks automatically the validity of these arguments, EXCEPT for *inner_params*. 
      Thus, the user should be sure of what he is doing when setting the *inner_params*.
    
    * only *dynT_user* and *dimT_user* are mandatory. For all other arguments, default 
      value is used if no value is passed by the user.

.. _construct_inputs_from_visualea:

Construction of Adel input tables using Visualea
====================================================
The node ``plantgen`` allows to construct the inputs of ADEL. 

.. figure:: image/plantgen_node.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   plantgen node
   
   
``plantgen`` is located in ``alinea.adel.plantgen``. 
You can access to ``plantgen`` through the package explorer of VisuAlea, 
or just typing "plantgen" in the Search tab of VisuAlea. 

The associated widget, which appears when you open ``plantgen``, permits to 
configure the construction. 

.. figure:: image/plantgen_widget.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   plantgen widget

The following dataflow demonstrates how to use ``plantgen`` through Visualea:

.. figure:: ./image/plantgen_dataflow.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   The alinea.adel.Tutorials.plantgen dataflow 

The user must select existing data nodes to set the input and ouput tables.

The following data-flow demonstrates another way to use ``plantgen`` through 
Visualea:

.. figure:: ./image/plantgen_csv_dataflow.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   The alinea.adel.Tutorials.plantgen_csv dataflow 

In this case the user must give the paths of csv files for inputs and outputs. 

.. warning:: the paths set in alinea.adel.Tutorials.plantgen_csv will not work 
             on your computer. You have to adapt them to your needs.

Finally, the node ``read_plantgen_inputs`` permits to define the values of the input ports of 
``plantgen`` by importing a Python module. ``read_plantgen_inputs`` is also located in 
``alinea.adel.plantgen``. 
    
For example, using ``read_plantgen_inputs`` with the module 
:download:`plantgen_inputs.py <../../adel/data/plantgen_inputs.py>`, 
the dataflow becomes:
    
    .. figure:: ./image/plantgen_csv_inputs_dataflow.png
       :width: 100%
       :align: center
        
       The alinea.adel.Tutorials.plantgen_csv_inputs dataflow 
   
``read_plantgen_inputs`` permits the user to store the values of the input ports, 
so he can reuse them later.

.. _inner_parameters_for_construction:

Inner parameters for the construction of the input tables 
========================================================== 
These parameters are:

* :attr:`SECONDARY_STEM_LEAVES_NUMBER_COEFFICIENTS <alinea.adel.plantgen.params.SECONDARY_STEM_LEAVES_NUMBER_COEFFICIENTS>`: 
  the coefficients *a_1* and *a_2* to calculate the final number of leaves on tillers from the final number of leaves on main stem.

  ratio between the maximum number of green leaves on the tillers and the maximum green leaves on the main stem
* :attr:`DELAIS_PHYLL_COL_TIP_1ST <alinea.adel.plantgen.params.DELAIS_PHYLL_COL_TIP_1ST>`: 
  delay between tip appearance and collar appearance for the first leaf only.
* :attr:`DELAIS_PHYLL_COL_TIP_NTH <alinea.adel.plantgen.params.DELAIS_PHYLL_COL_TIP_NTH>`: 
  delay between tip appearance and collar appearance for all leaves except the first one.
* :attr:`DELAIS_PHYLL_SEN_DISP <alinea.adel.plantgen.params.DELAIS_PHYLL_SEN_DISP>`: 
  the time during which a fully senesced leaf on a non-elongated internode remains on the plant.
* :attr:`DELAIS_REG_MONT <alinea.adel.plantgen.params.DELAIS_REG_MONT>`: 
  the time between the start of the regression and the start of MS elongation.   
* :attr:`TT_DEL_FHAUT <alinea.adel.plantgen.params.TT_DEL_FHAUT>`: 
  the thermal time at which leaves on elongated internode disappear.
* :attr:`FIRST_CHILD_DELAY <alinea.adel.plantgen.params.FIRST_CHILD_DELAY>`: 
  the delay between a parent cohort and its first possible child cohort
* :attr:`REGRESSION_OF_DIMENSIONS <alinea.adel.plantgen.params.REGRESSION_OF_DIMENSIONS>`:

These parameters can be set by the user through the input argument *inner_parameters* 
of the function :func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>`, or 
set directly in the module :mod:`params <alinea.adel.plantgen.params>`. 
They permit a finer parameterization of the construction.

See :mod:`documentation of params <alinea.adel.plantgen.params>` for more information.  

Description of Adel's outputs
*******************************

The function :func:`RunAdel <alinea.adel.AdelR.RunAdel>` permits to simulate 3D architectural 
development of the shoots of wheat plants, according to a list of dates (thermal times) and 
Adel's inputs (see :ref:`adel_input`).

Appendices
************

The appendices describe the data used by Adel for pre and post-processings. 
The appendices also contains static and dynamic view of the system, to 
help the user understanding hwo it works. 

Construction of the input tables 
=================================
In this section we first present internal views of the package :mod:`plantgen <alinea.adel.plantgen>`:

* a :ref:`static view <plantgen_static>` to describe the dependencies between the different modules of :mod:`plantgen <alinea.adel.plantgen>`,
* a :ref:`dynamic view <plantgen_dynamic>` to describe the data flow when the user calls :func:`gen_adel_input_data <alinea.adel.plantgen.plantgen.gen_adel_input_data>`.

Then, we describe the data used in the construction of the input tables of Adel:

* :ref:`dynT_user_FULL <dynT_user_FULL>`: the dynamic of the Haun stage of 
  **at least** the most frequent non-regressive axes.
* :ref:`dynT_user_SHORT <dynT_user_SHORT>`: for each *id_axis*, the dynamic of the 
  Haun stage of **exactly** the most frequent non-regressive axes.
* :ref:`dynT_user_MIN <dynT_user_MIN>`: the dynamic of the Haun stage of 
  the most frequent main stem, and, for each primary axis, the thermal time when 
  Haun Stage is equal to the final number of phytomers. 
* :ref:`dimT_user_FULL <dimT_user_FULL>`: the dimensions of 
  **at least** the most frequent non-regressive axes.
* :ref:`dimT_user_SHORT <dimT_user_SHORT>`: the dimensions of 
  **exactly** the most frequent non-regressive axes.
* :ref:`dimT_user_MIN <dimT_user_MIN>`: the dimensions of the most frequent 
  main stem. 
* :ref:`phenT_abs <phenT_abs>`: the equivalent of :ref:`phenT <phenT>`, but 
  with absolute thermal times and absolute phytomer ranks.
* :ref:`dimT_abs <dimT_abs>`: the equivalent of :ref:`dimT <dimT>`, but with 
  absolute phytomer ranks.
* :ref:`dynT <dynT>`: the dynamic of the Haun stage for each axis. 
* :ref:`phenT_first <phenT_first>`: a subset of :ref:`phenT_abs <phenT_abs>`, 
  containing only the lines of :ref:`phenT_abs` which correspond to the first 
  phytomer of each cohort.
* :ref:`HS_GL_SSI_T <HS_GL_SSI_T>`: the dynamic of Haun stage, green leaves and 
  senescent leaves when thermal time varies, for each cohort. 
* :ref:`tilleringT <tilleringT>`: the dynamic of tillering.
* :ref:`cardinalityT <cardinalityT>`: the theoretical and the simulated cardinalities of 
  each cohort and each axis.
